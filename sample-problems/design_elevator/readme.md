## Design elevator

Before coding, We need to understand the product/system properly.
To understand the product/system -
- we should know why and where we need this product - Purpose
- who are the users - Product Users
- how users will use this product - Product feature

Now, let's talk about why and where we need elevator ?

Where we need this ?

In multi-floor Buildings. It could be office buildings, residential buildings,
or malls.

Why we need this?
We are not superman, obviously we need something to go from one floor to
another or move some items from one floor to another.

One solution is use stairs, but obviously it's very tiring,
gonna take lots of effort and time.

That's why we need elevator to reduce our effort and save times.
